EmpathyScope API for Google App Engine
======================================

Everyone loves emotions, or hates them, but computers have a hard time with them.

The opensource Synesketch library has methods for computing emotion weights for text.

I thought it would be fun to create a small API for App Engine that lets you pass in text and get back emotion weights as json, for use in other bigger apps.

App Engine is free and that's nice, so you can use mine if you want (http://empathyscope.appspot.com/?q=I+am+really+happy+and+a+little+surprised+this+worked...).

However, if you want your own... here's the code.

Enjoy!
